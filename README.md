The State of our Nation App
by Charles Winston


Overview:

This application is a PSA about how strange, and scary,
the situation in our country is right now.


Usage:

Follow the instructions the application gives in
order to find the PSA message. Be warned, it may
scare you.


Running requirements:

You must have Node, React Native, React Navigation,
and Android Studio installed. In order to run on an
Android emulator, open your emulator from Android
Studio and type:

react-native run-android

in your shell. This may take some time on your
first build.


Documentation and Resources:

This app began using Create React Native App,
using tutorials found at
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
I then had to eject the app from Create React
Native App in order to build on the Android Emulator.
I used the instructions found here in order to do so:
https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/EJECTING.md


What I Learned:

- Name your app something smart. And keep your names
  consistent. It is not fun to figure out how to change
  them. I ran into a lot of trouble where there were
  different names for my project and my app, and it
  took me a while to figure that out.

- Building can take a really long time.

- React Native is extremely powerful and way better
  than Android Studio.
